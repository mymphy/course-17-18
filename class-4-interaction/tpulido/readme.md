## Background

In this exercise I have added interactivity to the bar chart. I've added a sort function with the help of [Titus Wormer his code](https://cmda-fe3.github.io/course-17-18/class-4/sort/).

I've added a new transition (easeElastic), changes to the the X axis label and general style.
