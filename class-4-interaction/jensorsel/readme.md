# Applying interaction

In this assignment, we apply interaction in d3.

## Background

I've taken one of my earlier assignments (barchart) and applied a 'sort' interaction to this, meaning that when the checkbox is clicked, the highest column is shown first.

I've done this by taking the [sort example](https://github.com/cmda-fe3/course-17-18/blob/master/site/class-4/sort/index.js) from the course's repo, and applying it to my [bar chart](https://cmda-fe3.github.io/course-17-18/class-1-bar/jensorsel/) from class 1.

To make this work, I had to change some variables around. I've also updated the data, to include more (recent) days.

I initially wanted to go with a 'filter' interaction on a bubble chart - however - I couldn't do this. I could only do this in a hacky way with normal JS, no relation to d3 and thus not related to the assignment.
