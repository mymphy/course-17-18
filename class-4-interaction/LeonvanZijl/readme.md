## **Description**
In this assignment I used the Bar Chart from Github by Titus as an example to give a static Bar Chart a similar effect. I downloaded a basic bar chart from the d3 gallery (see sources). From there on out I started puzzling with the code to get the desired effect:

**Steps**
1. Checked how I could change the data in the console without any triggers etc..
	```
	data.sort(function(x, y){
		return d3.ascending(x.letter, y.letter);
	});
	```
2. From there on out I replaced that sorting state to the one Titus used:
	```
	function sortOnName(doesnt, matter) {
		return d3.ascending(name(doesnt), name(matter));
	}
	```
3. This required other functions like `name()` which then required more functions
4. After implementing all the functions I had the basics up and running, I used just the functions I needed and removed all the extra's
5. Instead of a checkbox I used a span as a button (ye, could've just used a button instead ðŸ™ƒ) so I didn't need the if else statement at the top
6. I also changed the delay to animated the bars all at once. Like that better. So I deleted the `delay()` function
7. I used multiple event triggers on the span to let it toggle between sorting by name and age
8. Styled all the elements so it's easier on the eyes
