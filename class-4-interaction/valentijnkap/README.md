# Interactivity

!(Preview)[preview.png]

## Background
For practice I had a assignment to add some interactivity to chart of choosing. I used an old chart that was based on d3.v3 so I changed it to v4 and used an other chart. 

## What i did to make this work
I wanted to aim high so I found a chart in the gallary on github from [Mike Bostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887051). I want to make that chart sortable but I couldn't figure out how. I started to read to code and tried to understand it. I have tried many options but I didn't succeed. That's when i made a new plan.  

I used the a basic chart from [Mike Bostock's](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304) and changed so it would match my preference. After that I looked at the code from Titus Wormer the [sort example](https://github.com/cmda-fe3/course-17-18/tree/master/site/class-4/sort) and used some code to make it sortable. To match my data I had to change some labels.

## To do
It works for the most part but there are still some bugs I can't figure out due the deadline. Whats still wrong about it:

* The labels at the bottom don't swift like the bar's. Actually they don't change at all. I mis some function to let it work.
* When clicking the sort buttons a couple of times the gutter betweens the bar's are getting bigger. You notice that the bar's don't match the labels.
