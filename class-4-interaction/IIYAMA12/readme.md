# Interaction
For this graph I applied a click event to start manipulating the data, so that I could recreate the graph. But unfortunately it doesn't allow to apply transitions. It is just reloading the data in a different format after clicking on the right element. For assignment 2 I will try a different approach, because it is far from fancy. Also I will spend some more time on cleaning my code, because I debug far too much (to get an better understand of what every piece of the code does).

## Interaction
If you click on a group of elements, it will show a preview of the selected data alone so you can compare it. After 2 seconds it will return to the previous state.
