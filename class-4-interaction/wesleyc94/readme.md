# Interactivity
I've added interactivity into my bar chart.

## Background
In the code I've added a small bit of code to create transactivity into my bar chart, this bar chart was used in a previous exercise and i've decided to make it more fancy. In the code i've added an on click event onto a checkbox which will trigger the small transition making the columns move.

## Data
The data comes from a CSV file. The chart is a bar chart.

## Features
- [`d3-select`](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#api-reference)
- [`d3-axis`](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis#api-reference)
