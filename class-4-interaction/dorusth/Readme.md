# Interaction
This is my design masterpiece with a sorting from the data in alphabetical order per language and descending sorting by amount of speakers.

## Background
The used dataset is a dataset about the amount of people who speak a certain language in the world.

## Technique used

A eventlistener is placed on the checkbox and when checked

I sorted the data by language as default sorting and used ```d3.ascending``` to sort the languages by amount of speakers.



## Features

*	[d3-dsv](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv) - parse tab-separated values
*	[d3-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format) - number formatting
*	[d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale) - position encodings
