# Style
Styled version of the [provided code](https://github.com/cmda-fe3/course-17-18/tree/master/site/class-2/style).
A simple responsive donut chart visualising the populations of various age groups with pretty colours based on a [bl.ock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887193) by [@mbostock](https://github.com/mbostock) (GPL-3.0).

## Background
The [code](https://github.com/cmda-fe3/course-17-18/tree/master/site/class-2/style) is now written in my preffered way of writing. 
I separated the HTML into head and body. I used "" for linking to my files. Closed the body tag. I use plenty of tabs and create new lines to keep everything easy to read.
