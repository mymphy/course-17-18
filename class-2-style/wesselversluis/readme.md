# Style 

I copied all the files from assignment 2: Style and changed them to my likings. In the HTML I added some tags and indentation. 
In the CSS I added a lot of indentation, tabs & spaces. ~~Whitespace is your friend~~

### For the JS part:
First I declared all the variables, the functions afterwards. I like to end expressions with ; and place } on a new line (see below). 
That way I can quickly see where I start and end.

```javascript
function fill(a) {
    return color(age(a));
