# Reformat code
This assignment was made in order to learn reformatting code without changing the function

## Background
Several changes were made in the html, css and js files.
A lot of spacing was added to make things more readable. After the css selector i added spaces.
In the js things are now grouped and spaced out, variables are now on top and the functions on the bottom.
