# Style homework assignment

### Short description
Re-order and customize the code given by the teacher.

### Deeper description
After downloading the code from the Github website I first re-ordered everything. All the code was in single lines.. To make it more clear I added enters and space inbetween each line to make the code more understandable. I did this to all given files (index.csv, index.css, index.html and index.js), after doing this i tried understanding the code and adding comment lines to the index.js file of the code that I was able to understand.
