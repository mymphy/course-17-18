 ##### Background
 I made this donut as homework for the second lecture of Front end 3. The instruction was to clean up the code and make it your own preferred style.

 ##### Data
 The chart visualizes the the populations of various age groups.

 ##### Style
 I made changes to the index.css file with beautify. I made changes in the index.js with beautify and seperated some parts by hand, also added semicolons for clarity.
