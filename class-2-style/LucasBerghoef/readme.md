# Class 2: Style

In this assignment I've learned to refactor and reformat code.

## Background
For this assignment I had to reformat code to make a donut chart in my own style. 

The style choices I made in the code were as following:
* Moved the var to the beginning of the js.
* Devided the js document with tabs so functions start in the far left.
* Broke up the values of the "colors" in the var so they become more readabl;e.
* Used tabs to format each element within a var or function to their own position horizontally.

## Data
The data in this file is completely made up for learning purposes.

## Features
