# Style
An exercise in refactoring minified code.

## What did I do?
I refactored the code making only changes in the way **the code** looks, not how **the visualisation** looks. I made the following changes:

### html
* added spacing and tabs to create a clear overview
* put every line on a new line
* added `</body>`

### css
* added spacing and tabs to create a clear overview
* ended every line with a `;`

### js
* changed the order: global variables at the top and functions at the bottom
* added a `;` at the end of every line
* put every variable declaration on its own line starting with a *keyword* `var` 
* extra spacing and tabs
* renamed *parameters* `b` with `error` and `c` with `data`

The minified code was made by [@wooorm](https://github.com/wooorm). He based his visualisation on a [`block`](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887193) by [**@mbostock**](https://github.com/mbostock).
