# My own style

In this example I learned to develop my own style in writing code. The chart used is based on a [`bl.ock`](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887193) by [**@mbostock**](https://github.com/mbostock) (GPL-3.0).

## Background

All changes I made in the code where to get it more to my liking. I made the code readable. In the `javascript` I moved all variables to the top and added a `Enter` on a few lines. I also changed all `''` to `""`.

In the HTML I added a `head` and `body` and added `""` to all links.

> For the css I only used beautify to make it readable.
