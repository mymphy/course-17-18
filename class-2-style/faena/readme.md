# Assignment 2: Style

## Description
This document includes stylistic choices I've made to the supplied code. 

## HTML
* Added title '@faena'
* Put every line of code on new line
* Added `html`, `head`, and closing `body` tags for neatness' sake
* Fixed indentation 

## CSS
* Added semicolons (`;`) where missing
* Fixed indentation
* Broke up `font-family` per line
* General formatting, adding spacing, etcetera

## JS
* Fixed indentation 
* Moved all `var` declarations to the top of the document
* Moved `render` function to the bottom of the document
* In the `render` function, replaced `b` with `err` 
* In the `render` function, replaced `c` with `data`
* In the `render` function, replaced var `a` with `g`, because it was used as a group and `g` makes more sense.
