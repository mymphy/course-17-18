# How I like to clean my code.

When I start to clean up my code I like to use plug-ins to most of the dirty work for me at first. I use beautify for the various types of code to clean them up roughly.
After that i'd like to adjust the code some more to suit my personal taste. I like to put spaces where it is possible so it doesn't look cramped up and I also find it easier to read and find certain lines of code this way.
I also like to group aspects via comments. In the end I think all of this results in a easier time for me when I am coding.
