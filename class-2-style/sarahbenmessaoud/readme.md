# Style
In this assignment i’m going to refactor this code:
[the responsive 'donut' chart @wooorm](https://github.com/cmda-fe3/course-17-18/tree/master/site/class-2/style) .


## Background
I have rewritten the code to find and apply my style in writing code. This assignment trains this.

I have used the extension ‘Beautify’ to style my code. What it does:

* Code to execute on the next.
* Empty line between elements
* Using space is okay
