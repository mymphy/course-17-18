# Bar chart!

This Read me will explain what i'm showing in this chart

## Background

This was an exercise for front-end dev. 3 to visualise data by using d3

## Mobile data usage for October so far

I decided to show the data i've used in october so far, well at least the 6 most udes apps

## Data

There are two data types I use:

* `MB` - The amount of data a app used.
* `apps`   - which apps used the amount of data

## Features

*	[`d3-dsv`] https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv - parse tab-separated values
*	[`d3-format`] https://github.com/d3/d3-format - number formatting
*	[`d3-scale`] https://github.com/d3/d3-scale - position encodings
