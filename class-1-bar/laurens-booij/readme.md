## Description
I have downloaded this bar chart from [d3' chart library](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery) and edited it a bit. This was part of a school assignment, aimed at understanding the code behind an interactive bar chart which utilised the d3 framework.

## Background
I have downloaded the [following](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304) chart. I copied the code and separated it different files. Also there was a separate tsv file included.

The following languages are used:
* HTML
* CSS
* js
* tsv

After that I made changes to the labels and values. Last, I added some CSS to change the colors and add a transition.

## Data
The data and the labels that are used do not hold a clear meaning. I changed it from the initial data to get a better understanding of how to do so. The initial data that came along with the bar chart contained data about the frequency of each letter in the alphabet.

The dataset that is used is the following:

| Label         | Value         |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| OPDR:         | 1.2           |
| LOAD          | 1.15          |
| .             | 1.1           |
| F             | 1.05          |
| E             | 1             |
| D             | .95           |
| 3             | .9            |
| ..            | .85           |
| LAUR          | .8            |
| ENS           | .75           |
| ...           | .7            |
| BOOIJ         | .65           |
| M             | .6            |
| N             | .55           |
| O             | .5            |
| P             | .45           |
| Q             | .4            |
| R             | .35           |
| S             | .3            |
| T             | .25           |
| U             | .2            |
| V             | .15           |
| W             | .1            |
| X             | .05           |
| Y             | .03           |
| Z             | .01           |
