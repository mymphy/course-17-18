# This is my bar chart assignment

### Short description
I downloaded a excisiting data visualisation on Github and personalized the code. 

### Deeper description
After downloading the code I tried to understand everything that was done by the creator. I split the elements into different files (index.css, index.js) for a better understanding of the code. After that I dug into the index.css file to customize the styling of the document, when this was done I started to add comments to the index.js file.

### Data explanation
The data I used for this assignment is based on the hours of sleep I got last week.

### Features
