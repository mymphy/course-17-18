##### Background 
I made this visualisation as homework for the first lecture of Front end 3. The instruction was to use an existing bar chart, put in your own data and make some changes to the style of the chart. 
> The chart i used came from https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304 and has been made by Mike Bostock.  

##### Data
The chart describes the hours of sleep per day. The X-axis describes the day where the Y-axis describes the hours of sleep. The data came from a TSV file.
* **TIP when using brackets text editor; do not adjust the TSV file in brackets itself. Just open the standard texteditor on your system and adjust the data in there.**
