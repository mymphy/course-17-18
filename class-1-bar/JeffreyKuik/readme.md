# FeD - Assignment 3 - Bar Chart

### BACKGROUND
This is the third assignment for the course Frontend Development 3.
The data in this assignment was collected as a part of the course Data Visualisation.


### DATA
In this chart you can find the visualised data of the amount of steps I've made between September 20 and October 4. Every day lists the amount of steps I've made on that day. Some days have more steps than the others because of active and lazy days.

Each column on the x-axis represents a day. Each column on the y-axis represents the amount of steps I've made.
