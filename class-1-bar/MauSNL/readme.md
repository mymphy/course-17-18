# H1 Playing with barcharts and d3.

### H3 Short description
This bar chart is a result of me playing around with d3 and trying to use data to create charts. This is the barchart variant.

### H3 Background
This barchart was a result of me learning how to use d3. Its a basic sample i used to understand the possibilities of d3 and play around with it. Sometimes it broke, and I would either reset or try to make it work again.

### H3 Data
The values on the axis are totally random and so are the values displayed in the graph. The data for purely to make the chart work and let me see what it could do. The data was pulled from a .tsv file wich displayed the letter frequency. 

### H3 Features
This simple bar chart is constructed from a TSV file storing the frequency of letters in the English language. The chart employs conventional margins and a number of D3 features:

- d3-dsv - parse tab-separated values
- d3-format - number formatting
- d3-scale - position encodings
- d3-array - data processing
- d3-axis - axes
