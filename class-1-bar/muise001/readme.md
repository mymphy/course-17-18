# Bar Chært Ultimatum 97

This is a bar chart that show's the population of all people living in The Netherlands ordered by provence.

## background

This bar chart was originaly made by (https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887051). I removed several graphs to make it my own. I also changed the color of the bars and changed the values. The graph originaly conained six grouped bar-charts wich all contained seven values with their own data. I made it into one grouped bar-chart with the twelve provences of The Netherlands as value and changed the data to the real population per provence.

## Data

Both the X-axis and the Y-axis were changed and the colors of the bars.

* `X-axis` - I removed all the names of the grouped bars, made it into one bar and had it labeled 'Population of The Netherlands'
* `Y-axis` - This value fortunately changed automaticly as I changed the data of the bars
* `Colors` - I changed all colors to (in my opinion) more suiting collors. Offcourse I had to add a view colors because I used more values.
