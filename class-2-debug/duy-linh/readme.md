# Debug!

## Background 

This was an exercise for Front-End 3 to debug errors in the code, by using the console.

## What did I do to fix it?

- In the HTML file the links to the CSS and JS file were written wrong.
- In the CSS file some units and values were mispelled.
- In the JS file I fixed 'd3.tsv('index.tsv', row, onload);' to 'd3.csv('index.csv', row, onload);' and some more mispelled values. 
- After upgrading d3 to d4, new errors came up. Some values were written wrong, because of the updated library. Fixed them too.
