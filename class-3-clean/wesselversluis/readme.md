# Clean

## Description
For this assignment I cleaned up data to correctly display on a chart. I chose the cities Vlissingen, De Bilt and Arcen. The last one especially because I went to the very sweet Hertog Jan Brewery over there.


## What steps did I take?

* Cut the text to only show data we want to use
* Use correct data objects
* Erased unusual whitespace
* Map the correct data on the chart
