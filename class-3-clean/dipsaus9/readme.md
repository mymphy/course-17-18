# Bar manipulation of the KNMI website
For this assignment i made a chart with the csv downloaded from the KNMI website.

### How did i do it?
I started of this assignment with the the given index.html by @wooorm. From this point i downloaded 4 different datasets from the KNMI website. As you may know these datasets are terrible to work with. So i changed the data from the dataset to a csv dataset by using javscript. At first this was a bit difficult cause i got stuck on the nesting part. I completly forgot to nest all the values for each location.

### What is next?
From a usefull csv i could change this data into a working chart that has already been made.
