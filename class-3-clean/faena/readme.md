# Clean

## Description
This was a dataset with unclean data which I've cleaned in order to display it correctly in a line graph. The date chosen was 24-12-2016, my birthday last year, which was extraordinarily warm for that time of year. 


## Steps taken
* Changed charset 
* Cut off header 
* Trimmed out whitespace
* Changed dates from txt file to date objects
* Pasted together columns (dates and times) from the text file 
* Nested data in variable with `d3.nest`
