# Clean

In this challenge we had to clean up some data to later use it in d3js.

## Changes I made

* First, I compared the `.txt` file to the `example.json` file. The only information I needed to pattern out this format, were the locations, tempertures and data (specific to the seconds). I needed 'STN' and 'YYYYMMDD' to get these numbers.
* After being hopeless and miserable, I saw some examples in the assignment page. Got a good look at the code, tho.

#### Clean up:
* Use `.indexOf()` to search for strings, to select characters in the code and store them.
* Save the labels in `var = header`, slice this off with `.slice(header)`.
* Use `.replace(/ +/g, '')` to replace all spaces to nothing, so it's readable.
* Use `.replace` again, to replace # with nothing.
* Use `d3.timeParse("%Y%m%dT%H:%M:%S.%LZ")` to create a time parser. For some reason this didn't work with `d3.timeParse('%Y%m%d')`. Got some info on this [here](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format).
* use `var = places` to store the rows as csv with `d3.csvParseRows(doc, map)
* Then, return location, date and temperture in proper units. 
* use d3.nest to return var = places and put the new data (proper units) in this var.


## Data

The data originates from [kmni.nl](https://projects.knmi.nl/klimatologie/uurgegevens/selectie.cgi) where I picked  `260 De Bilt`, `285 Huibertgat`, `240 Schiphol` and `380 Maastricht`. By downloading this dataset, we got a .txt file that had a lot of information. Besides the temperature, we got the hourly wind speed, duration of sunshine and so on. Quite a challenge to cut out all this information and store this in the right variables.

## Features

* [`d3.nest`](http://learnjsdata.com/group_data.html) - produce groupings to use in data analyse
* [`d3.csvParseRows`](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv#dsv_parseRows) - parses string in csv format
* [`d3.timeParse`](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format) - parses time in location specific format

The indexOf() method returns the index within the calling String object of the first occurrence of the specified value, starting the search at fromIndex. Returns -1 if the value is not found.
