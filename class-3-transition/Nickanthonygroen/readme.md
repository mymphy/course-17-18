# Transition

In this assignment we had to pick a static chart for us to make transitions with. The key was to play around with the transition functions.
I tried to do some weird stuff with the chart, but my knowledgde and available time only took me so far.

## Features

.selectAll
.append
.transition
.delay
.active
