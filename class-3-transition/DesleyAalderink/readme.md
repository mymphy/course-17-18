# Bubble chart popper

Original Bubble chart from [D3 library](https://d3js.org/) by [@mbostock](https://github.com/mbostock).


[Original chart](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269) 

## What I did

The assignment was to make transitions with d3 on a chart that didn't have any.

Changes I made:
* If you hover the bubble, it will change the color to blue with a fade in.
* If you click the bubble, it dissapears.
