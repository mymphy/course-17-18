# Transition
Class 3 - transition teaches how to use transition() and d3.ease to a d3 graph

## Background
I chose the Chord diagram made by Mike Bostock (https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062006), this diagram has nog build in interaction or transition
I changed the colors to a more cold pallet (this chart uses a .range with 4 colors inside to determine the colors) and
i made another variable called colorAlt for the colors after the transition

The colors change from a cold pallet to a warm color pallet in 3 seconds with a cubic transition

In order to change the text on the right i used some javascript to make the text change on load,
the actual transition is done in css.
