# Transition
Adding a transition to the chart.

## Background
In the code I've added a transition and an ease to let it bounce and fade. It will transition the colors, starting off with silver towards red. After this it will slowly bounce and fade away.

## Data
The data comes from a index.CSV file. The chart is a bubble chart.

## Features
- [`d3.select`](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#select)
- [`d3.ScaleOrdinal`](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleOrdinal)
