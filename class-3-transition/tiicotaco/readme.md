# Class 3 - Assignment 2 - Transition

## Short description
A assignment done for the Front End 3 course at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. This assignment was all about adding transitions to an excisting data visualisation. The original code was writtin by, [@mbostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock). You can find his visualisation at [population pyramid](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062085).

## How did I do it?
First I went online to bl.ocks to find an apropiate visualisation. I downloaded the one made by [@mbostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock) and got it working. Then I split the CSS, HTML and Javascript to different files and started adding comments to all of the Javascript (at least of what I thought it did). Then I started thinking of some cool animations. I used some of the given one from the slides, and used a [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38983807/how-to-animate-a-horizontal-d3-bar-chart) tip I found online. I used the same way of animating to get the x and y axis flowing in. I used delays to make it seem like a little story, instead of all items floating and appearing at the same time.


## Code used
Most of the cleaning data part (removing stuff) I learned and 'copied' from the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TpoPilc1qVIQU07u_IdPeNqSZcbgliPaLF0zZUWGvWE/edit?usp=sharing) of our third class. After that was done I used a couple of links found on the internet to better understand the nesting that had to be done. Two I found really helpfull were;
