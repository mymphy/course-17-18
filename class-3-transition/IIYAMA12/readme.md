# Transition
Adding transitions to an existing and complex graph from the internet. It was really important to understand where in d3 the code had to be applied. Because at someplaces in the chain it wasn't allowed to add transitions.


## Features:
``` javascript
d3.transition() // https://github.com/d3/d3-transition
.delay(1000) // delay
.duration(1000) // duration
.ease(d3.easeLinear)), // ease functions
```
