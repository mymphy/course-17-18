# Transition
For this assignment I used https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269.

## What I did
* Seperated the HTML & JS.
* Changed the data to the amount of points Dutch football clubs won the last season.
* Changed the name of the data-file from flares.csv to punten.csv.
* Changed the color-scheme, used another one from the D3 library.
* Adjusted and commented on the code to understand everything.
* Added transitions and played around with different options to get to know them.
