# Bubble Chart of my weekend activities 

A overview of my weekend activities sorted by days

## Background

For this assignment we had to change data from a chart and make transitions in it.
I put in my own data + legend. After that I added a transition for the circles to appear.
The second thing I added was a mouseenter function that makes the groups selected pop.

## Features 

``transition``
``ease``
